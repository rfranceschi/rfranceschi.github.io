title: About me
---

I am a physicist and data scientist with a PhD in astrophysics, experienced in turning complex datasets into actionable insights. My background combines advanced modeling, simulation, and statistical analysis with strong programming skills in Python and SQL. I have designed and implemented data pipelines, developed and tested predictive models, and worked with containerization tools like Docker to ensure reproducibility and efficiency.

In my academic work, I built sophisticated simulation tools to model physical systems and compared them to real-world observational data, drawing meaningful conclusions from noisy and incomplete datasets. I am now focused on applying these analytical, computational, and problem-solving skills to industry challenges, particularly in data-driven decision making, AI solutions, and technology-driven innovation.
