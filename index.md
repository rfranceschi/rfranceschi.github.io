title: About me
---

My research interests include mass estimates of protoplanetary disks, their dust evolution, and gas distribution in the
context of planet formation.

My works focus on the development of disk theoretical models and their comparison to observational data. My expertise is
the comparison to interferometric data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Northern
Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA).

More specifically, my work involves the simulation of the emission and dynamics of solid dust particles, and how growth
mechanisms affects their distribution. Since the distribution of solids is strongly affected by the embedding gas, I
also use molecular emission lines to map the gas distribution. Using radiative transfer calculations, I create synthetic
images of these models and compare them to interferometric data to estimate what disk structure can best reproduce the
observations.
