### Mass determination of protoplanetary disks from dust evolution

The mass of protoplanetary disks is arguably one of their most important quantities shaping their evolution toward planetary systems, but it remains a challenge to determine this quantity. Using the high spatial resolution now available on telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), recent studies derived a relation between the disk surface density and the location of the "dust lines". This is a new concept in the field, linking the disk size at different continuum wavelengths with the radial distribution of grain populations of different sizes.

We use dust evolution modes to test the dependence of the dust line location on disk gas mass, and we calibrate the analytic relation between the dust line location and the disk mass using a population of synthetic disks. We find that radial pressure bumps can alter the location of the dust line by up to ~10 au, while its location is mainly determined by the disk mass. In particular, we tested the reliability of the method for disks showing radial substructures, as recent high-resolution observations revealed. Therefore, we used these models to calibrate the relation between the dust grain drift timescale and the disk gas mass. We investigated under which condition the dust line location is a good mass estimator and tested how different stellar and disk properties (disk mass, stellar mass, disk age, and dust-to-gas ratio) affect the dust line properties. Finally, we apply this method to observed disks such as TW Hya and AS 209, which have been observed at high angular resolution with ALMA and show pronounced disk structures.

Our models show that the determination of the dust line location is a promising approach to the mass estimate of protoplanetay disks, but the exact relation between the dust line location and disk mass depends on the structure of the particular disk. We calibrated the relation for disks without evidence of radial structures, while for more complex structures we ran a simple dust evolution model.

The plot shows the mass estimate from both approaches for a large population of syntetic disks. The analytical relation sistematically overestimates the disk mass by a constant factor.</figcaption>
