### Modeling Cosmic Ray Propagation with Data-Driven Simulations

I explored how low-energy cosmic rays travel through turbulent, inhomogeneous molecular clouds. Using high-resolution observational data and Monte Carlo simulations, I analyzed how particles gain and lose energy, get trapped, and contribute to ionization in the interstellar medium.

The work combined computational modeling, statistical analysis, and the handling of complex datasets to uncover subtle patterns in particle behavior. By comparing simulations with observations, I was able to test and refine models of cosmic ray propagation in realistic, non-uniform environments.

This project highlights how advanced data techniques and modeling can be applied to study complex, stochastic systems, revealing insights that are not immediately apparent from raw data alone.

### Mass determination of protoplanetary disks from dust evolution

Determining the mass of protoplanetary disks remains one of the key challenges in understanding how planetary systems form. Using high-resolution ALMA observations, I modeled the evolution of dust grains within disks to explore how their radial distribution—the “dust lines”—relates to the underlying disk mass.

The approach combines synthetic populations of disks with numerical simulations of dust evolution, accounting for radial substructures, pressure bumps, and variations in stellar and disk properties. By comparing the models with well-studied systems such as TW Hya and AS 209, the work highlights how disk structures influence measurable properties and allows for refined mass estimates based on dust dynamics.

The analytical method consistently overestimates disk masses by a roughly constant factor.</figcaption>

### Constraining the turbulence and the dust disk in IM Lup: onset of planetesimal formation

Understanding how dust evolves inside protoplanetary disks is key to explaining how planets form. In this project, I studied the dust structure of the IM Lup disk by combining near-infrared polarized light and millimeter observations, which probe different grain populations and disk regions.

I developed a physical model of the dust distribution and used radiative transfer simulations to generate synthetic observations at multiple wavelengths. By fitting these simulations to real data through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, I constrained the vertical and radial distribution of dust and quantified the level of turbulence in the disk.

The results reveal strong size segregation, with millimeter-sized grains concentrated in the disk midplane, consistent with efficient grain growth and rapid settling. The inferred disk structure suggests conditions that may favor the early stages of planetesimal formation.
